BCE Core Library
===================

The main function of this library is to **balance chemical equations** and help you to **deal with complex chemical equations**. It also contains some features(listed following) which can be re-used to build your own application.

Main features
-------------

 - Balance chemical equations (includes ionic equations, equations with multi-solutions, equations with SRU, equations with hydrates, electronic transferring equations, equations with abbreviations and indefinite equations).
 - Substitute unknown symbols in chemical equations which contain one or more unknown symbols.
 - Auto-correction.
 - Predefined abbreviations and user custom abbreviations.
 - Humanity error output.
 - High precision calculation, hardware is the only limitation.
 - Cross platform (fully written by Python).
 - Multi languages support.
 - Simple API to help you integrate this library to your own application.
 - PyCharm development support.

Re-usable functions
-------------------

 - Chemical equation parser (BCE syntax).
 - Molecule equation parser (BCE syntax).
 - Electronic expression parser (BCE syntax).
 - Math expression parser.
 - Solve linear equations.
 - Dictionary-based locale system.
 - A stack implementation.
